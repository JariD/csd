# SimpleSynth

## Introduction
This is the final assignment for Creative System Design 2B. The assignment was to build a simple synthesiser in C++.
The synth must contain:
- A synth baseclass and 2 subclasses.
- An oscillator baseclass and a minimum of 3 oscillator subclasses.
- Some sort of UI melody playback integration.

## Plan of approach
For this assignment I tried to keep it as true to the assignment as possible, I made 4 oscillator subclasses and 1 baseclass.
The synth has a synth baseclass and 2 subclasses: an FM synth and an additive synth. 
The synth parameters are hardcoded but editable before compiling.


### What went well:
I was able to change my workflow around and only focus on the assignment. Build it up step for step and backtrack in the last weeks to really understand the flow of C++.

### What could've gone better?
It took quite a while adjusting to the C++ syntax. Expecially after an intensive block of Python and being a student assistent for the first year students that are working with MAX msp and Javascript.
As an "apprentice coder" the syntax were interfering with one another, at the end of the assignment it finally really clicked.

### What did I learn
I learned that I want to give priority to CSD, to get the most out of the classes and get really comfortable with coding. I also improved my git incorporation into the workflow.

## End result
I am very happy with the end result. I have 2 sounding synth types and have all the requirements for the final assignment.

## Take aways
The past few weeks have been really eye-opening. I've covered a lot of distance in the past week, especially in the last week where it really clicked as I stated before.

## Effort
In the beginning I had around 4 hours of time every week besides work and other assignments/projects. As the block progressed I was able to up that time to around 8 hours. And in the last week I programmed around 2-3 hours every day.
I've had consistend git updates with some re-ocurring inconsistencies on work days. I think I put about 50 hours into the final assignment.
